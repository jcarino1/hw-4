Boolean Operations in Lua (20 Points)

1a. Booleans I (10 Points)

  t = {}
  function g(t,k)
      t[k] = t[k] or 0
  end

  Explanation:
  A table t is created. The function g does not return anything but it takes in
  the table t = {} and a different value k. t[k] on the left side of the 
  assignment operator will always be false because it is the exact same thing 
  as the t[k] on the left side. Because t[k] is always false then it will always
  assign t[k] to 0.

1b. Booleans II (10 Points)

  function h(a)
      return (a > 0) and a or -a
  end

  Explanation:
  A function h returns a positive or negative number. When (a > 0) is false, the
  and statement will return the first operand, so the statement becomes (a > 0)
  or -a. The or operator returns the second operand when the first is false, thus
  when (a > 0) is false, -a is returned. When (a > 0) is true, the and statement
  returns a, so the statement becomes a or -a. Since a is true, the or operator
  will return a.
